# Experiment

This directory contains example code in the shape of unit tests that shows how different packets are instantiated and allows you to run the tests to see how large the packets end up etc.

If you add your own experimental protocol to the `proto` directory just name the tests after the proto file you specified it in.  So for instance `foo.proto` should be named `foo_test.go`.
